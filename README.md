A simple macOS application to scrobble vinyl records to Last.fm.

## About

Vinyl Scrobbler is a menu bar application that allows you to scrobble your vinyl records to Last.fm using Discogs as the source for track information. Simply search for your album using a Discogs release ID or URL, start playing, and let the app handle the scrobbling.

See https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCzAQBuSGUt/?igsh=eTJrY2xjd2F2OWpw for why I created it.

## Features

- Menu bar application for macOS
- Search albums by Discogs release ID or URL
- Automatic track duration fetching from both Discogs and Last.fm
- Real-time "Now Playing" status
- Track-by-track scrobbling
- Visual countdown timer for each track
- Support for multi-artist releases
- Automatic handling of Discogs artist name variations (e.g., disambiguation numbers)
